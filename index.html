            <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;"id="side-bar-essay">Working in Photography 04 has been an absolute pleasure. This quarter I’ve come to learn more advanced photography concepts while also getting to further explore my creativity.

I found it fascinating how shutter speed, F-stop, and ISO, values could be manipulated not just to improve the visual quality of an image, but to also completely change the whole feeling and story a photograph tells. Through careful study and practice in the field I now better understand in which situations each technique excels and am proud to show off my work this quarter. 

While I was previously aware of concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines, it was refreshing to take a deeper dive into composition and learn about additional concepts like depth, framing, and contrast.

One photo I’m particularly proud of in this regard is “Temple.” I think that using the leafs and tree in the foreground to frame the far off temple utilizes the techniques from our lectures well and helps to create a more dynamic image. Before this quarter, I certainly wouldn’t have been able to compose a shot like this.

Moreover, in this course I’ve cultivated a deeper appreciation of the incredibly important role lighting plays in photography. I remember learning that the Greek roots of photography mean “drawing with light.” But I never realized just how true that was until starting work on my own photography projects. By making use of a very long shutter speed and low ISO I could literally draw in the air using light. I never thought I’d be able to draw in 3D as if in Virtual Reality, but thanks to the skills I’ve learned this quarter I can now remove the “Virtual” from that equation.

This quarter I’ve learned and experienced so much more than I thought I would. And I feel incredibly lucky to have had the chance to work with Professor Jordahl who has been nothing but exceptional both in teaching and kindness. From the knowledge and experiences I’ve accumulated in this class, I no longer see the world a layman, but as a photographer.
